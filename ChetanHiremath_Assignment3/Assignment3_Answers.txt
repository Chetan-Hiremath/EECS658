Manual Calculation of the Accuracy Value of the Neural Network Model = (sum of diagonal values of the Neural Network Model)/(total values of the Iris varieties) = (50+46+48)/(50+46+48+0+0+0+4+0+2) = 144/150 = 0.960

2. For each of the 11 other models, explain why you think it does not perform as well as the best one.
Linear Regression Model- This model doesn't perform well because it assumes that the features are independent, has linear data mostly, doesn't follow non-linear relationships, and doesn't consider covariances. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.

Degree 2 Polynomial Regression Model- This model doesn't perform well because it assumes that the features are independent and doesn't consider covariances. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.

Degree 3 Polynomial Regression Model- This model doesn't perform well because of its high degree that generates complex values even though the data is linear mostly. It assumes that the feature are independent, not interdependent. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.

Naive-Bayesian Model- This model doesn't perform well because it assumes independent features that are rarely true in the real world and doesn't consider covariances. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.

K-Nearest Neighbors Model- This model doesn't perform well because it performs poorly for high-dimensional data and doesn't consider independent data. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.

Quadratic Discriminant Analysis Model- This model doesn't perform well because it assumes Gaussian data that doesn't exist in the real world even though it considers covariances. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.

Support Vector Machine Model- This model doesn't perform well because there is overfitting if number of features is greater than number of samples. Its selection of kernel function is critical for determining the dividing line between classes. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.

Decision Tree Model- This model doesn't perform well because it has the tendency to overfitting and the small variations in the data that generates a different tree. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.

Random Forest Model- This model doesn't perform well because it has a small sample size of the training data, and trees are trained with random subsets of training data and features. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.

Extra Trees Model- This model doesn't perform well because it chooses thresholds randomly and doesn't choose the most discriminative thresholds, and the best threshold is picked due to the splitting rule. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.

Neural Network Model- This model doesn't perform well because it is sensitive to feature scaling and susceptible to overfitting. It doesn't have a way to find a quick solution, and different weight initializations give different results. So, its performance is worse than the LDA's performance.
